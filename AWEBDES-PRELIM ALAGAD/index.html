                <p>So what is Desolve? The short answer is that it comes from the combination of design and evolve, something we hope we're doing constantly. 
                    A slightly longer version is that we're a collection of photographers, designers, and creatives who enjoy urban photography. During our travels around the country,
                     we take time to document the cities we love. You'll also occasionally find articles on design, our thoughts on the latest trends, and the odd posting on photography.</p>

                <h2 class="line">So... what aren't we?</h2>
                <p>Professional photographers, for one. Please keep in mind that we're strictly amateur photographers. We submit these galleries out of love and creative expression. 
                    We're not likely to remember the settings we took the picture at, or even what lens we had. We're also not very exclusive. If you like what you see here, and want to participate,
                     we'd love to have you. All galleries, articles, 
                    and posts go through a submittal and approval process, so if you're interested, drop us a line and tell us what you have in mind.</p>
                    <p>We also occasionally have meetups. If, for example, we know we're coming to Miami,
                     we'll let everyone know and schedule a meet-up day to tour the city and take photos. If you'd like us to visit your city, let us know.</p>
